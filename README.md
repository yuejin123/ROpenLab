# R Open Lab
Columbia University Digital Centers R Open Lab

In the 2016-2017 academic year, I worked as a teaching intern with the Digital Science Centers of Columbia University, hosting R Open Labs and workshops. 

Usually during the first 20-30 minutes of the open labs, we will talk about a specific R package/technique. The rest of the open lab will be free discussion about any topic/personal project in R among participants, or between participants and the instructors. 

As data analysis becomes increasingly important in a multitude of research areas ranging from biology to history, R is becoming an essential research tool. I hope by sharing the materials I used for all the R Open Las and workshops, more people could find R to be a useful tool for the projects they are working on.
