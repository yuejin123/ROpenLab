# R Open Lab


In the 2016-2017 academic year, I worked as a teaching intern with the Digital Science Centers of Columbia University, hosting R Open Labs and workshops.

Usually during the first 20-30 minutes of the open labs, we will talk about a specific R package/technique. The rest of the open lab will be free discussion about any topic/personal project in R among participants, or between participants and the instructors. 

I hope by sharing the materials I used for all the R Open Las and workshops, more people could find R to be a useful research tool. For any further inquiry, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at <yj2360@columbia.edu>.
