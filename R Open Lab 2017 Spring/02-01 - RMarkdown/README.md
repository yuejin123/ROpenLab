## For first-time users:

* Download and install (you will need both R and RStudio):
R for Mac OS X
<https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/R-3.3.2.pkg>
R for Windows
<https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.3.2-win.exe>
R Studio for Mac OS X
<https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.dmg>
R Studio for Windows
<https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.exe>

* Learning with Swirl
To install swirl, first install R if you haven’t already and open it. 

In the command line, type
install.packages("swirl")

and hit Enter. You need a working internet connection. Once R has installed the package, you also need to load it. Type
library(swirl)

and hit Enter. Once you do that, swirl will take over and start giving you instructions (and peppy feedback!) to take you through the basics of R. Have fun!
