##readr package
R Open Lab - 2017 February 8th

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read csv/xls data. It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. 

Today we will talk about the Shiny. We’ll cover the following topics

1. Why do we use readr?
2. Functions available in this package

## For first-time users:

* Download and install (you will need both R and RStudio):
R for Mac OS X
<https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/R-3.3.2.pkg>
R for Windows
<https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.3.2-win.exe>
R Studio for Mac OS X
<https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.dmg>
R Studio for Windows
<https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.exe>

* Learning with Swirl
To install swirl, first install R if you haven’t already and open it. 

In the command line, type
install.packages("swirl")

and hit Enter. You need a working internet connection. Once R has installed the package, you also need to load it. Type
library(swirl)

and hit Enter. Once you do that, swirl will take over and start giving you instructions (and peppy feedback!) to take you through the basics of R. Have fun!
