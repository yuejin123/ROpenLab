This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Global setting

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=5, fig.height=5,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
setwd("/Users/yuejin/Downloads")
```

## Simple plotting
```{r}
one <- c(1:50)
four <- (1:50)*0.8+0.3
plot(four~one)
plot(four~one, xlim=c(1,50), ylim=range(four), pch=10)
plot(four~one, xlim=range(one), ylim=range(four), pch=16,col=3,main="random plot")
title('Random Plot')
abline(a=0,b=1,col=1)
?abline
filename = 'R OpenLab Oct 12'
dev.copy(device=png, file=filename, height=600, width=800)
dev.off()

theta <- (1:50)*0.92
plot(theta, sin(theta),xlab=expression(sqrt(theta)),col=colors()[1:50])
help(expression)
dev.off()
```

##Different kinds of plots
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(mtcars)
attach(mtcars)
?mtcars
colnames(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
plot(wt, mpg,main="Milage vs. Car Weight",xlab="Weight", ylab="Mileage", pch=18, col="blue")
text(wt, mpg, row.names(mtcars), cex=0.6, pos=4, col="red")
dev.off()

library(lattice)
hist(wt)
densityplot(~mpg,main="Density Plot",xlab="Miles per Gallon")
barplot(wt)


```


# Relationship between housing power and Miles Per Gallon?
```{r}
#Practice
```


## How to represent categorial data?
```{r}
library(DAAG)
data(tinting)
attach(tinting)
colnames(tinting)
densityplot(~age|sex*target)
xyplot(csoa ~ it|sex*agegp, data=tinting)
table(agegp, sex)

example(bwplot)
example(qqmath)

store <- read.table("store.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
info <- read.table("info.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE) 

head(store)
a[3]<-NULL
```


# What's the difference between weekly sales during holiday and non-holiday?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plot overall weekly sales first. Set axis labels and title. Set color to red. 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Throwback to Excel file import
```{r}
library(gdata) 
help(read.xls)      
```
