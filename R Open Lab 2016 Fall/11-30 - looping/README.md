R Open Lab - 2016 Nov 30th

Today we will talk about writing loops in R. Looping is equivalent to iterating or just replicating instructions. Let the computer take over the repetitive work and you will find your life becomes much easier. 

1.	Control flow commands: for, while, break, next.
2.	Syntax of loop
3.	Nested loop

## Learning with Swirl (Get started with R)
To install swirl, first install R if you havenâ€™t already and open it. In the command line, type
**install.packages("swirl")**
and hit Enter. You need a working internet connection. Once R has installed the package, you also need to load it. Type
**library(swirl)**
and hit Enter. Once you do that, swirl will take over and start giving you instructions (and peppy feedback!) to take you through the basics of R. Have fun!
